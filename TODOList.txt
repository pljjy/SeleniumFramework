future:
- add BDD with SpecFlow

in progress:
- make a basic nUnit framework
    * integrating extent reports to webdriver with CustomDriver class
    * should add sort assertions to the CustomDriver
    * implement basic driver methods to CustomDriver with sort assertions so they can be used directly instead of instance.driver.method
    * maybe use extensions for CustomDriver instead of regions?
- add TestContext.Parameters (use --tp instead of --p)

optional:
- add docker support
