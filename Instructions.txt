rename ./Tests folder to your project name
./Tests/Site should store methods for tests in ./Tests/Test

if it's possible try to avoid making methods with WebElement, instead use By to match the project style 

these files should have the same name:
    * test file
    * corresponding file with methods
    * corresponding test data file
    
Utilities/config.json info:
    * implicit-wait uses seconds
