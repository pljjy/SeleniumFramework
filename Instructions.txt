rename ./Tests folder to your project name
./Tests/Site should store methods for tests in ./Tests/Test

these files should have the same name:
    * test file
    * corresponding file with methods
    * corresponding test data file
    
Utilities/config.json info:
    * implicit-wait uses seconds
    * add any information you need to in system-info (like "0S": "CentOS 8.5-2111"), don't remove show-browser-in-system-info and it's used directly in the code
